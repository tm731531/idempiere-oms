# Installation Guide

This module contains two parts:

1. The OSGi plugin (Java implementation)
2. The PackOut ZIP file (menu and metadata definitions)

---

## Step 1: Install the OSGi Plugin (JAR)

1. Open the plugin project in Eclipse
2. Go to:  
   `File > Export > Plug-in Development > Deployable plug-ins and fragments`
3. In the wizard:
   - Select the plugin project (e.g. `tw.tom.oms`)
   - Set **Destination Directory** (not archive)
   - Uncheck `Export as a zip file`
   - Click **Finish**
4. This will generate a `.jar` file, e.g.:
  tw.tom.oms_1.0.0.jar

5. In iDempiere:
- Login as **System Admin**
- Go to `OSGi > Console`
- Click **Install**
- Upload the `.jar` file

âœ… After installation, the plugin will be active.  
ðŸ›‘ However, **no menus or windows will be visible yet** â€” see next step.

## Step 2: Import the PackOut ZIP (Menus and Folders)

To register menus and folders, import the provided PackOut file:

1. Go to:  
`Menu > Pack In/Out > Import`
2. Choose the file:  
`OMS-1.0.4.zip` (included in this repository)
3. Click **Import**
4. After import:
- OMS menu entries and folders will appear
- You can navigate to the new UI via Menu

---

## Notes

- The **plugin (.jar)** provides backend logic (e.g., order sync jobs)
- The **PackOut (.zip)** defines menus, folders, windows, and processes
- You must install **both** for full functionality
- OMS menus are not auto-generated by plugin.xml â€” they are defined via PackOut

---

## Uninstallation

To remove the plugin:

- Go to: `OSGi > Console > Installed Plugins`
- Find `tw.tom.oms`
- Click **Uninstall**

To remove the menus:

- Go to: `Application Dictionary > Menu`
- Locate OMS-related entries
- Delete manually (if needed)
