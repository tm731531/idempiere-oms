## Database Tables

| Table         | Description                                                |
|---------------|------------------------------------------------------------|
| `oms_platform` | Master table for defining platform information (API host, key, etc.) |
| `oms_channel`  | Defines each actual store/account under a platform         |

Example:
<pre> oms_platform 
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Cyberbiz, Shopee, Momo... 
  
  oms_channel 
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Shopee-Store A (linked to Shopee) 
  ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Shopee-Store B 
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Cyberbiz-TW Main Store  </pre>


Hence, we designed a separate `oms_channel` table to handle these variations.<br>

## Scheduler (configured by Tanet account)

1. Configure platform-level data.
2. Configure channel-level data.
3. Register relevant processes with the scheduler.

   * If the platform requires token refresh, be sure to include `OMSRefreshTokenProcess`.

## Platform Notes

Some platforms follow a third-party integration design. In such cases, the platform **must be configured with the corresponding app information first** (App ID, Key, Host, etc.).
